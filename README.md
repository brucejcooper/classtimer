# Class Timer application
A friend works as a teacher, and has different class times each day, often just a few minutes different from day to day.  He also needs his kids to clean up before the end of the class, so he asked me to write a timer that will tell him (and his students) when the current period is going to end, and add an audible warning that reminds everyone when to start packing up.

This is written as a React application
